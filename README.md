## Project Goals

To make it simple for web developers to add instantaneous visual feedback for touch interactions. 

## Features

* Ultra-lightweight - way less than 1k minified.
* MIT license: use it wherever you want.
* Designed for responsive design: safe for use in cross-device development
* Framework-independent: use with any JS library, or none at all!

## Usage

1. Place a copy of FastActive.min.js on your web server.
2. Link to your copy of FastActive.min.js just before the the closing body tag of your HTML pages. 
3. There is no step 3!

Alternatively, you can just paste the FastActive source into the a script tag at the bottom of your HTML pages to save yourself an HTTP request.
